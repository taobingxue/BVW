You and your loving girlfriend have just arrived back home and realized that the kitchen is filled with cockroaches! Your girlfriend absolutely detests cockroaches and she's the target of these pests.

So roll up your sleeves and strech out your legs because you need to protect her from these roaches. Using Kinect's motion sensing, you can stamp the cockroaches on the floor and the wall of your kitchen
while trying not to accidentally hit your own girlfriend. Your girlfriend's happiness is expressed through her facial expressions as well as a meter in the top right corner. You have two minutes to make sure that she is happy and not angry and running out of the house.
